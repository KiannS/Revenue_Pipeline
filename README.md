Seattle Software Developers Revenue Pipeline Application 

Professional Summary:
I developed and deployed a comprehensive client management tool using Google AppSheet, leveraging modern JavaScript to develop bots and workflows. 
The purpose of this project was to facilitate efficient client tracking for management. Key features include project management with payment history, due date tracking, and project details. 
Additionally, automated bots were implemented to send timely payment reminders and provide weekly profit and cost insights based on budget and revenue data.

Full Features Included:

Adding new/existing projects 
Integeration with CopperCRM and Google Drive to back data into the cloud servers
Automated workflows and bots that send email remainders to employees when payment is due and build calenders with data about daily and weekly revenue and cost 
Payment plans based on project type: Retainer or waterfall
Insights page: Provided graphs and other helpful insights based on data provided. Such data included: Graphs, total profit, total cost, profit per client, etc.
Budgets: Page dedicated to manage company reoccurring payments such as advertising, food, etc. 
Pages to display both client payments and developer payments with their respectitive information.
Each project had a dedicated page with various functionality, including adding payments, commission percentages, 
etc. Using such information, total commission, next payment date, runnign total, percent complete, etc. are calculated and automated. This allivates the need to manually calculate such data. 
NOTE: All calculated columns are located under "Formulas"
